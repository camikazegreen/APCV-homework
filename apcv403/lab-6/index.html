            <h2>Addendum</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The first thing that I did was move my "lastModified" script in to my new script file and couldn't get it to load. I figured out that I had to wrap the whole function in a 'DOMContentLoaded' EventListener, because the script was running before the footer was being rendered.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>It took me a while to figure out how to get each menu item to relate to the company descriptions, so I had to do some research to learn about adding data attributes and how to access them via javascript.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>When I added the instructions div and the javascript to hide it when you hovered over your first menu item, all of the rest of the code stopped working! I couldn't figure it out for a while, and at first I thought it had to do with changing the reference for "this" so that it wasn't calling the right element. I ended up changing around the order of the scripts to try to get it work and none of it was working. It turned out that I had just forgotten to close the div tag on the instructions element, so the problem was caused by malformed html rather than a problem with my javascript directly.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Lastly, once I created this addendum, it expanded beyond the declared size of the footer so I had to figure out how to get it to display properly.</p>
